# aurelia-search-demo

A simple search component using [Aurelia](www.aurelia.io).

## Getting Started

Before you start, make sure you have a working [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) environment, preferably with NPM 3.

From the project folder, execute the following command:

```shell
npm install
```

This will install all required dependencies, including a local version of Webpack that is going to
build and bundle the app. There is no need to install Webpack globally.

To run the app execute the following command:

```shell
npm run dev
```

This command starts the Webpack development server that serves the built bundles.
You can now browse the skeleton app at http://localhost:3000. Changes in the code
will automatically build and reload the app.
